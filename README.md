# 🏃‍♀️Running App UI

After becoming annoyed at the couch to 5k app I built my own Running app. This web app enables uers to add, edit and view running routines and was built for my own personal use and not to impress anyone, hence a few bugs you may encounter. 

### 📋Aims of App

- Allow the user to have flexibility with their running routine; add various different functions such as run/walk/power for varied times
- The user can add/delete/edit routines
- The user can view previous routines
- The user can view previous runs and details such as time and route

### 👩‍💻Technical Details

- ReactJS
- Webpack
- React-Query
- Tailwind CSS
- React testing-library

### 🔧How to Run the App

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the directory
- Run `yarn` and then `yarn start` in the terminal
- Live demo: [https://focused-einstein-01316c.netlify.app/](https://focused-einstein-01316c.netlify.app/)

### 💭Future Improvements

- Improve the responsive design
- Move POST to react-query
- Fix RunDetails test
